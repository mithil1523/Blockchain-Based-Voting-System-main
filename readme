Blockchain-Based E-Voting System
Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based electronic voting system that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting processes. The system leverages blockchain technology to provide a decentralized platform for voting, eliminating common issues in traditional voting systems such as fraud, manipulation, and security breaches.

Features
1)Decentralized Voting: Utilizes blockchain for decentralization, making the voting process resistant to tampering and fraud.
2)Secure and Anonymous: Voter identities are protected, and votes are recorded anonymously, ensuring privacy.
3)Immutable Ledger: All votes are stored on an immutable blockchain ledger, ensuring transparency and traceability.
4)Transparent Results: Results are publicly visible in real-time, with no room for manipulation.
5)Smart Contracts: Uses smart contracts to automate the election process, reducing human intervention and errors.

Technologies Used
1)Blockchain: Ethereum, or any other blockchain platform for deploying the application.
2)Smart Contracts: Solidity (for Ethereum-based implementations).
3)Frontend: React.js or any other modern JavaScript framework.
4)Backend: Node.js with Express or any backend framework.
5)Database: IPFS (Interplanetary File System) or any decentralized file system for storing voting data securely.
